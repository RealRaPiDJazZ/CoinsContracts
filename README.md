Coins/Contracts Incremental

Author: RaPiDJazZ

Update 0.1.5: (Tables, Tollbooths and... err... Terabytes?)

Added: Table so everything is sorted, data generation and data upgrade (OP, might be nerfed), 

To do:

Long-ish term:

-Figure out better way to do achievements (Object classes?)

-Formalise a proper method of recognizing upgrades

-Actually have some css to make it look ok, instead of horrible

-Have some kind of prompt for achievements. Currently: No prompt.

-Saving

Can be done soon-ish with current code:

-Figure out where the game gets boring 

-Tollbooth contracts/second increase (scales with amount of tollbooths bought?)

Original intended progression: (DEFINETLY not current progression)

-Only has spare change locator and welcome to incremental upgrade (buys them both)

-25 coins: Unlocks coins -> contracts

-Buy beginning of contracts -> Unlocks paid interns (building), free contracts (upgrade)

-10 spare change locator -> Makes spare change locator give 1 coin/second, 2 coins/click, unlocks coin flip stealer

-Free contracts -> Buying 1 paid intern

-2 Paid interns -> Unlocks professional slacker

-25 contracts -> Unlocks donation bucket

-50 spare change locator -> disables it completely

-21 donation bucket/coin flip stealer -> donation bucket is now cheaper than coin flip stealer (7500 coin mark)
